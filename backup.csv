Word,Definition
piteous,"deserving or inciting a feeling of sympathy and sorrow
Marley struggled to banish the smile from his face as he floated to Scrooge's sitting room and let loose a piteous howl.
Use the adjective piteous when you want to describe something that deserves your feelings of compassion and sympathy. A baby's cry, a miserable facial expression, and a pleading voice can all be piteous if they make you feel bad and want to help."
hoary,"having gray or white hair as with age
The hoary old warrior looked as if he had bitten into something he did not like the taste of.
Use the adjective hoary to describe something that is old and worn out — like the hoary jokes your great uncle Albert clings to.
The word hoary can also be used to describe something that is white or gray with age. Santa is usually depicted with a hoary beard and hoary hair."
pinnacle,the highest level or degree attainable
stalwart,She was one of the few woman of her generation who reached the pinnacle of Washington’s conservative business community.
winsome,"A pinnacle can be a physical thing, like the top of a high mountain or the antenna on the very top of a building, or it can be a high point that can’t be measured with a ruler, like an achievement or a goal. Whatever the pinnacle is, reaching it is almost always a completion of something where you have gone the highest you can go."
repartee,"adroitness and cleverness in reply
He described it as one of his top five experiences, adding that he ""loved that repartee with the audience"".
additional definition: witty and spirited conversation. Late night talk show hosts are known for being experts at repartee, or clever conversation, with their celebrity guests. Repartee comes from the French word repartire which is a fencing term meaning an answering thrust with a sword. When you are engaging in repartee, you don't literally stab someone, but you come back with a quick sharp blow. Mark Twain defined repartee as, ""something we think of 24 hours too late."""
solace,comfort offered to one who is disappointed or miserable
trifling,She took solace in the belief that she would see her children in heaven — and in her seven successful births.
sacrosanct,"If something eases your disappointment or grief, consider it a solace. If you're sad, you might find solace in music or in talking to your friends."
gaunt,"It is no surprise that consolation and solace are similar in meaning as they share a root in the Latin verb s?l?r? ""to comfort."" In fact, solace and consolation are synonyms meaning relief from grief or disappointment. When you go to sleepaway camp, your parents will miss you, but they'll find solace in knowing that you are having fun."
strident,"unpleasantly loud and harsh
He saved some of his most strident remarks for discussing race and racism in a question-and-answer session after the speech.
Something that's strident is loud, grating, and obnoxious. (Think Pope's fire alarm). Your roommate's strident laughter as he watches cartoons late into the night might inspire you to buy a pair of ear plugs.
Strident is related to the Latin word strix , meaning ""screech owl."" This is a kind of owl that doesn't hoot. It screeches in a strident way."
esteem,an attitude of admiration
sovereign,"This hardly comes as a surprise, given DeLillo’s 40-year writing career and the esteem in which many of his books have been held for decades."
requite,"Esteem derives from the same Latin word that gives us estimate, and back in the day, esteem, like estimate meant ""to assess, or judge the value of something."" That sense lingers today. When you say you hold someone in high esteem, it means you give them a high value."
knoll,a small natural hill
clamor,"Tromping up a hill, I enter a bucolic scene: a grassy knoll bearing weathered barn structures seemingly staged for being painted years later."
retainer,"A knoll is a small hill or mound of earth, which makes a shady knoll a perfect spot for a summer picnic."
constrain,"Moreover, he may feel less constrained than his successor to cut a deal with House Democrats.
Constrain can imply both literal and figurative bindings. You can constrain someone by physically holding on to something like a person's shirt. Or, you can figuratively constrain someone by putting up obstacles. Teenagers, for example, may feel constrained by parents' rules and accuse them of sucking the fun out of their social lives."
contention,"a dispute where there is strong disagreement
But both men’s remarks before their meeting made it clear that Syria is the main point of contention.
There is nothing ""content,"" or satisfying, about being in contention, and that's probably because the word contention means being in a competition that ends with one side, usually the winning one, being content."
dalliance,"the act of delaying and playing instead of working
But after a decades-long dalliance with cars, could the pendulum be swinging back?
A dalliance is a playful flirtation, one that might lead to a casual romance. The king's public dalliance toward the lady in waiting shocked everyone in the court except for the queen. First appearing in Middle English, the noun dalliance stems from the verb dally, meaning ""to waste time, to act playfully, especially in a flirtatious way."" Dalliance often describes a casual flirtation — generally something short-term and not very serious."
punctilious,"marked by precise accordance with details
Greece is not that punctilious about such fiscal matters.
A punctilious person pays attention to details. Are you always precisely on time? Is your room perfectly neat? Do you never forget a birthday or a library book's due date? Then you are one of the punctilious people.
The adjective punctilious, pronounced ""punk-TIL-ee-us,"" is related to the Italian word puntiglio, meaning ""fine point."" For someone who is punctilious no point is too fine, no detail too small, to be overlooked."
bounteous,"given or giving freely
After all, TV viewers have never enjoyed as bounteous an array of quality entertainment options.
Things that are bounteous are plentiful and generously given. Your friends might celebrate your birthday by bringing you a bounteous armful of flowers.
Farmers planting their crops in the spring hope for a bounteous harvest in the summer, and the very best elementary school teachers have bounteous amounts of affection for children. Bounteous things are found in great abundance."
